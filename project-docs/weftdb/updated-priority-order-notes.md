# Updated priority order — notes

*The checklist for this section is in the [roadmap](https://github.com/basic-automation/weftdb/blob/main/ROADMAP.md). What follows is the writing that used to sit between its items.*

**Move up immediately:** 1) Weft-Bench · 2) public API/server · 3) InfluxDB Line
Protocol ingest · 4) Prometheus/OpenTelemetry instrumentation · 5) physical numeric
encodings · 6) Storage v2 columnar segments · 7) GPU batching + async · 8)
compression v2 prototypes · 9) online ingest/query benchmarks · 10) correctness/
durability semantics.

**Keep, but narrow:** connector abstraction (start with ILP, CSV, Parquet, HTTP) ·
TUI (demos/debugging, not the primary interface) · pattern/event pipeline (after
engine benchmark credibility) · GPU memory-mapped buffers (after transfer bottlenecks
are measured).

**Defer:** Thorchain-specific connector · multi-GPU · full distributed Raft/cluster ·
GPUDirect/BaM direct storage · full vector-DB positioning · large TUI expansion ·
vendor-specific integrations before benchmark proof · deep ML/event prediction before
core engine wins.
